Library Management 

The Library Management System is a simple program designed to help manage the process of borrowing and returning books in a library. This system operates without using a database, meaning all data is handled temporarily while the program is running. It allows users to record which books are borrowed and returned efficiently.

The main purpose of this system is to simplify library operations by keeping track of borrowed books, due dates, and returned items in an organized way. Although it does not permanently store data, it provides a basic structure for understanding how borrowing and returning transactions work in a library. This project helps demonstrate the core functions of a library system using simple logic and programming techniques.
